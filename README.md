# Loan Prediction Model using SVM

This repository contains a simple loan prediction model implemented using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The model utilizes the following libraries:

- NumPy: For efficient numerical computations and linear algebra operations.
- Pandas: For data processing, including reading and manipulating CSV files.
- Seaborn: For advanced data visualization and statistical plotting.
- Matplotlib: For creating visualizations and charts.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning tasks, including the SVM algorithm, train-test split, and performance evaluation metrics.

## Dataset

The loan prediction model is trained on a dataset that contains relevant features for predicting loan approval status. The dataset can be found in the repository. The data is pre-processed and analyzed using the Pandas library to prepare it for training the SVM model.

## Installation

To run the loan prediction model, follow the steps below:

1. Install the necessary libraries by executing the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the model implementation.

4. Run the code to train the SVM model, evaluate its performance, and make loan predictions.

## Usage

To use the loan prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have installed the required libraries and downloaded the dataset.

2. Load the dataset using the Pandas library and perform any necessary data preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values or encoding categorical variables.

3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn.

4. Instantiate an SVM classifier using the `svm.SVC` class.

5. Train the SVM model on the training data using the `fit` method.

6. Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

7. Make loan predictions on new, unseen data using the trained model.
